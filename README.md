Little Game. Purpose ? learn to code a game with Canvas AND use Babbel, NPM, etc...

![Look and feel on 27/06/2016](/screenshots/20160627.png?raw=true "Game map")


# install

Install node/npm. Then run `npm install` and `npm install --save-dev babel-preset-es2015`.

When done, you can run `npm run build` to compile ES6 Engine class to make the game work.

# TODO
- ~~Make the viewport bigger~~
- ~~Make tiles use image instead of drawRect~~
- ~~Beveled pixels like Deepnight's games~~
- Create a tile map editor for the game that exports for the game Engine
- Create a Rooms / Scenes system to make a better storytelling
- Allow text display on events (change room, interaction with a certain tile etc...)
- Try to implement sound (POC)
