Little Game. Purpose ? learn to code a game with Canvas AND use Babbel, NPM, etc...

# install

Install node/npm. Then run `npm install` and `npm install --save-dev babel-preset-es2015`.

When done, you can run `npm run build` to compile ES6 Engine class to make the game work.

# TODO
- Make the viewport bigger
- Create a tile map editor for the game that exports for the game Engine
- Make tiles use image instead of drawRect (Pixel art tiles comming soon)
